    The forceAtlas2Based solver makes use of some of the equations provided
    by them and makes use of the barnesHut implementation in vis. The main differences are the central gravity model,
    which is here distance independent, and the repulsion being linear instead of quadratic. Finally, all node masses have a
    multiplier based on the amount of connected edges plus one.
